## Introduction

**The phrase "religious reasons" is the most effective excuse for pushing things through.**  
As long as freedom of religion is guaranteed, the phrase "religious reasons" works very well. Especially in Japan, for better or worse, it is so powerful, and it can be used against any kind of unreasonableness.  
Because of this, "religious reasons," whatever their content, are of great value.  
However, it is rare for Japanese people to use the term. This is because of the negative image of religion and the lack of understanding of it.  
It would be a shame, therefore, not to use the most practical and immediate reason, "religious reasons".  
So we thought it would be good if there was a religion for using "religious reasons", and if there was an equivalent scripture.  
Here, I created the MtoP Order, a religion for the use of "religious reasons."  
Our scriptures and doctrines do not contain definitions of God, rituals, or prohibitions. The following is a list of cases in which God has allowed the use of "religious reasons."

* If you are a follower of the MtoP Order, you can do all of the things mentioned above. Members of the MtoP Order may do all of the things mentioned above and may use "religious reasons" to do so if the use of the doctrine would improve his situation.

* To join the MtoP Order, simply follow @free_lance_god on Twitter. Followers of the account are defined as followers.

## Conclusion

The MtoP Order is a religion as media art. The tenets of our religion are promulgated in our scriptures and updated from time to time.  
The priority of our religion is that believers practice the doctrines at their own risk, and we do not allow the use of the scriptures if they cannot take responsibility for themselves.  
The Order will allow the use of the scriptures only when the believer chooses to use them.  
Neither the Order nor any of its associates will be held responsible for the consequences of a believer's self-selection and use of the scriptures.
